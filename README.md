BeatBox was coded with love over the course of a week by Tom Leslie Li.

Tom Leslie Li was born in Manhattan, New York. Although he graduated with a degree in Business Management and minor in Music Technology, through clubs and extracurriculars at SUNY Stony Brook University, he taught himself graphic design & editing - including much of the Adobe Creative Suite (Photoshop, Illustrator, Premiere, After Effects).

His inclination towards tech & software engineering has been fueled by his experience with both 2D & 3D animation. He hopes to combine these two interests at some point in his career.

Tomâ€™s hobbies include traveling, backpacking / camping, rock climbing & snowboarding.
He has 10+ years of piano experience & recreationally produces music on Ableton.

Tom is currently enrolled in App Academy's March 2022 cohort.
